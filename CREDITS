The semantics of the channel library are inspired by channels from the Go
programming language and the implementations of sending, receiving, and
selection are based on algorithms described in "Go channels on steroids" by
Dmitry Vyukov.

The map library uses prime numbers from "good hash table primes" by akrowne on
PlanetMath and the DJBX33X hash function by, well, Daniel J. Bernstein.

The mutex implementation was originally shamelessly copied from "Mutexes and
Condition Variables using Futexes" by Steven Fuerst but has evolved somewhat
since, probably for the worse. The spinning strategy of mostly yielding rather
than pausing is inspired by Webkit's Web Template Framework.
